# Chatbot from Scratch in Python using NLTK

This project demonstrates how to build a basic chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot is capable of handling simple conversational inputs and responding with predefined answers. It provides a foundational understanding of natural language processing and can be customized for various use cases by modifying the response patterns.
